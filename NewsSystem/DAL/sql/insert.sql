VALUES('DIWALI-The Festival of Lights', '2015-11-04 17:27:58', 'Diwali, one of the most important holidays on the Hindu calendar, is a time of reflection and contemplation of the past year, and a celebration of the new year to come. A festival of lights lasting five days, Diwali represents the triumph of good over evil and light over darkness. Holiday traditions include the lighting of special lamps and candles through the night, and the exchanging of gifts (usually sweets) to relatives and neighbors, wearing new clothes and lighting firecrackers.
It is an official holiday in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago, Malaysia and Singapore.
My best wishes to you and your family for a new year filled with good health, happiness and prosperity. Happy Diwali to all, and may you join ISA members and friends on Friday, Nov. 13 at 6:00 pm in Kunsela Lecture Hall and Rm A129, for an evening of Indian singing, dancing, food, and celebration.',

VALUES('Campus Hosts Regional Innovation Challenge Event', '2015-03-16 20:13:28', 'Students from SUNY Polytechnic Institute and other area colleges competed over the course of two days to create innovative solutions to the area most challenging social and economic issues. The inaugural “Innovation Challenge New York: Mohawk Valley,” supported by a grant from the Community Foundation of Herkimer and Oneida Counties, was hosted October 24-25 by the Utica campus of SUNY Poly.

The theme was “Harnessing the DIY (Do it Yourself) spirit to build community, economic, and cultural sustainability in the Mohawk Valley.” The intent was to launch an annual student competition that will take ideas and transform them into actions, improving the quality of life in the region.

Last spring, Robert Edgell, assistant professor of business, took four students to Philadelphia to take part in an “Innovation Challenge” event in which student teams competed to help a region solve its social, environmental or economic problems in new, fresh and innovative ways. Inspired by the experience, Edgell decided to bring that same forward-thinking to the Mohawk Valley.

“There is growing consensus in Herkimer and Oneida Counties that many of our brightest minds, educated locally, tend to migrate to other regions of the state or nation in search of economic and personal growth opportunities. In addition to this ‘brain drain,’ others are concerned about the lack of economic opportunities and entrepreneurial activity,” Edgell said. “This event brought students together with local DIY experts to help students become more entrepreneurial while increasing their propensity to remain in and be engaged with local communities. We also anticipate increased entrepreneurial activity, greater satisfaction with life in the area and increased area attractiveness to visitors and would-be residents.”

The 2014 Innovation Challenge New York: Mohawk Valley was led by SUNY Poly faculty Robert Edgell, assistant professor of business management; Daryl Lee, associate professor of communication and humanities; and Temple University’s James Moustafellos.',

VALUES('SUNY Blog: The Science of Star Wars Comes Alive in Nanovember!', '2015-11-13 10:27:12', 'A long time ago, in a galaxy not too far away, a movie franchise unlike what this world has ever seen was born. Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia were introduced to us, along with Darth Vader, and a generation of sci-fi fans were born. And soon a new generation will awaken, because this December the latest installation of the Star Wars Franchise, Star Wars: Episode VII arrives in theaters. And in preparation for this huge film release, SUNY Poly is working to teach kids a bit about the science portion of this science-fiction. This month is Nanovember, the 8th annual celebration highlighting Governor Andrew M. Cuomo’s high-tech investment strategy which has made New York State a globally recognized innovation hub for semiconductor and clean energy-based industry.

C-3PO_at_the_Museum_of_Man

The celebration has many new events but the one we’re most excited about is the opportunity to explore the science behind Star Wars. The activity is run by SUNY Poly’s Children’s Museum of Science and Technology, or CMOST. The Museum is currently based in Troy, although there are plans to move it to SUNY Poly’s Albany site. It’s mission is to “instill a sense of wonder and discovery in young minds, inspiring a lifelong exploration of science and technology.” And what has a greater sense of wonder and discovery than Star Wars?

On November 14 SUNY Poly CMOST will open its doors at no cost during this event that will give attendees an opportunity to explore the science behind Star Wars. Activities will include exploring magnetism and circuitry, and creating a mini light saber kids can take home. And who knows, maybe these kids will be inspired to come back to the STEM community in college and work on some droids of their own.

Or maybe they’ll follow in the footsteps of SUNY Maritime alumni Scott Kelly, and explore space, getting that much closer to the stars.',

VALUES('SUNY Poly To Provide Universal Access to CDTA Route Network', '2015-11-02 7:10:34', 'Albany, NY SUNY Polytechnic Institute, on behalf of its Colleges of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (SUNY Poly CNSE), and in partnership with the Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA), today announced it has joined the popular Universal Access program to provide unlimited rides on CDTA services to students, faculty and staff at no cost effective Monday, November 2, 2015.  The free service addresses increased demand for access to SUNY Poly CNSE’s Nanotech complex while reducing the potential for impact on traffic patterns in and around its facilities off Fuller Road in Albany.  The Universal Access program includes CDTA’s regular route services offering over 50 routes and connections throughout the region, STAR paratransit service and Northway Xpress (NX) Commuter service.

“With today’s announcement, the many benefits of CDTA’s Universal Access program are now available to all SUNY students and faculty in the Capital Region,” said SUNY Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher. “This innovative program broadens and enhances the SUNY college experience by making it easier – and free – for students to travel the region and take in all it has to offer. I commend SUNY Poly for securing this access for its students, faculty, and staff.”

“With the continued growth of SUNY Poly CNSE, it is important to enable new transportation opportunities for students, faculty and staff.  Through our partnership with CDTA, we are able to offer an innovative option that’s reliable, efficient and environmentally friendly,” said SUNY Poly President and CEO Dr. Alain Kaloyeros.  “Not only can students and employees access CNSE facilities through the Universal Access program, they can use it for all of their transportation needs throughout the region.  All they need is a valid SUNY Poly CNSE ID and they can travel to campus or retail centers or anywhere else serviced by CDTA.”

“We are pleased to partner with SUNY Poly CNSE to offer its students and employees unlimited rides on CDTA buses anywhere and anytime they operate,” said CDTA Chairman of the Board David M. Stackrow. “The Universal Access program has been an extremely successful initiative that promotes the many benefits of public transportation, while encouraging increased travel thought the Capital Region.  We are thrilled to welcome CNSE to the growing list of forward thinking colleges and companies participating with Universal Access.”

Currently, CDTA works with over a dozen colleges and businesses to provide unlimited access for students and employees.  Qualifying riders need only present a valid ID upon boarding to access the full complement of CDTA bus routes. The universal access model encourages riders to take full advantage of unlimited service and adopt a sustainable lifestyle by incorporating CDTA travel into their daily living beyond the commute to school or work.

Senator Neil Breslin said, “I applaud both SUNY Polytechnic Institute’s Colleges of Nanoscale Science and Engineering and the CDTA for partnering together to make this free Universal Access program available to their students and faculty.  This service is not only environmentally friendly, but by facilitating access of students and faculty with our community the economic benefits are innumerable as well.”

Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy said, “This is great news for all employees and students at SUNY Poly who will now have ready access to public transportation via CDTA’s Universal Access Program by simply using their ID cards. I commend SUNY Poly for providing this no cost transportation service, which will go a long way toward increasing access to good paying jobs, relieving traffic congestion and making our roads safer – and all while improving the environment. Dr. Kaloyeros should be congratulated for taking this far reaching step to assist faculty, staff, and students, which I hope will serve as a model throughout the region.”

Assemblyman John T. McDonald III said, “The participation of SUNY Polytechnic Institute with CDTA in the Universal Access program is not only smart but a wise partnership for both entities and the public that we serve. CDTA’s ridership continues to thrive due to partnerships such as this, which is important as we continue to grow our region but grow it with minimal negative impact on our roadways.  As ridership grows we can build the frequency of rides, which is a classic example of building success on success. SUNY POLY’s participation is a large part of that success and what I hope will be an inspiration to others to grow this program.

CDTA will provide bus service to SUNY Poly CNSE via new Fuller Road bus stops, which were constructed this past summer.  Four existing routes (#114, #117, #190, and #712) were expanded to serve the new stops.  A map detailing the revised routes is included.',
